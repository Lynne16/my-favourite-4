        <p>Alia Marie "Lia" Shelesh (born: October 22, 1992 [age 28]), better known online as SSSniperWolf is an English-born American YouTube personality known for her commentaries, DIYs, vlogs, reactions, and gaming content. I like Her Because her videos are very funny entertaining. She makes a simple video into a show . I wish to be like her.Alia originally started her YouTube career in 2012 on a channel called ‘sexysexysniper’ making gaming and Call of Duty commentaries. A year later however, she made a new channel which is now her main, leading to her deleting the old channel. Many have speculated that this is due to the questionable content that she created (mostly adult), and didn’t want her past image to look bad. Since 2017, the majority of the videos that she uploads are reactions and TikTok videos, along with occasional gaming and challenges.</p>
